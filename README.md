# Multifunc_Lund

> Does the number of functions affect the biodiversity - multifunctionality relationship?

All scripts to reproduce the analysis reported in Fig. X under the section: Number of functions can be found in the "number_of_functions" folder in the "Scripts" folder of the repository. These scripts also call functions from: ecological_drift_model.R, function_plotting_theme.R, MF_functions_collated.R and process_model_data.R. In addition, these scripts are numbered from 1-3 and should be run sequentially.

These scripts output .csv files into a folder called data. If there is no folder in the working directory called data, a folder is created automatically.
