# Title: Code to compare different metrics of multifunctionality given different function distributions

# load relevant libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

rm(list = ls())

# tell R where to call scripts from
source(here("Scripts/function_plotting_theme.R"))
source(here("Scripts/MF_functions_collated.R"))

# write a function to generate these function distributions
